## Learn these terms for your test.  Be able to write a few sentences describing each term.


- Pulse-Width Modulation: a modulation technique that generates variable-width pulses to represent the amplitude of an analog input signal. 
- Servo: Servo motors or “servos”, as they are known, are electronic devices. They are either linear or rotary actuators that are made push or pull parts of a machine with presicion
- Motor Encoder: a rotary encoder mounted to an electric motor that provides a close loop feedback signal that tracts the motors shafts' speed and/or position 
- Inertial Measurement Unit: measures and reports the raw or filterred angular rate and specific force/acceleration of the thing it is attcahed to.
- Proportional Integral Derivative Controller
- Point Cloud
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): a synchronous, multi-controller/multi-target (controller/target), packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductors. 
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): an electronic interface that provides a serial exchange between two devices
- GPIO

- Rethink Robotics : (formerly Heartland Robotics) is a robotics company co-founded by Rodney Brooks and Ann Whittaker in 2008. They aim to manufacture smart collaborative robots for small-medium sized enterprised.
- Willow Garage: a robotics research lab and technology incubator devoted to developing hardware and open-source software for personal robotics applications.
The company was most likely best known for its open-source software suite ROS (Robot Operating System), which has been rapidly and widely becoming a common, standard tool among robotics researchers and industry, since its initial release in 2010.
