- Aldebaran: known as SoftBank robotics, it is a company that leads the robotic space in creating humanoid robots. 
- Boston Dynamics: A robotics company that builds machines that can approximate the mobility, dexterity and agility of people and animals. They are an American engineering and robotics design company founded in 1992 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
- Rethink Robotics : (formerly Heartland Robotics) is a robotics company co-founded by Rodney Brooks and Ann Whittaker in 2008. They aim to manufacture smart collaborative robots for small-medium sized enterprised.
- Willow Garage: a robotics research lab and technology incubator devoted to developing hardware and open-source software for personal robotics applications.
The company was most likely best known for its open-source software suite ROS (Robot Operating System), which has been rapidly and widely becoming a common, standard tool among robotics researchers and industry, since its initial release in 2010.
- ClearPath Robotics: Clearpath Robotics, Inc. was founded in 2009 by a group of four University of Waterloo graduates. The original goal of Clearpath was to streamline field robotics research for universities and private corporations, but the company has since expanded and is now also manufacturing and selling the OTTO line of self-driving vehicles for industrial environments.
- 4Front Robotics: provide unmanned vehicles and perform services for complex missions
- Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility): A humanoid robot created by Honda in 2000. It is currently displayed in the Miraikan museum in Tokyo, Japan. 
- iCub: 1-metre-tall open-source robotics humanoid robot testbed for research into human cognition and artificial intelligence.
- Atlas: A bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company Boston Dynamics with funding and oversight from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The robot was initially designed for a variety of search and rescue tasks.
- Big Dog: A dynamically stable quadruped military robot that was created in 2005 by Boston Dynamics with Foster-Miller, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Harvard University Concord Field Station.
- Davinci Surgical Systems: a robotic surgical system made by the American company Intuitive Surgical. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, it is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach and is controlled by a surgeon from a console.
- Lego Mindstorms: a hardware and software structure which is produced by Lego for the development of programmable robots based on Lego building blocks.
- Gazebo: Gazebo was a component in the Player Project from 2004 through 2011. Gazebo integrated the ODE physics engine, OpenGL rendering, and support code for sensor simulation and actuator control.
- Sampling Rate: the number of samples taken per second.
- Aliasing: Aliasing is basically a form of undersampling a siganal that hasn't been properly recorded 
- Nyquist: a sinuisoidal function in time or distance can be regenerated with no loss of information as long as it is sampled at a frequency greater than or equal to twice per cycle
- bit-depth (quantization): refers to the color information stored in an image
- Baud rate: the rate at which information is transferred in a communication channel
- behaviour control: an approach in robotics that focuses on robots that can exhibit complex-appearing behaviors despite little internal variable state to model its immediate environment, mostly gradually correcting its actions via sensory-motor links
- cognitive robotics: a subfield of robotics concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to learn and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world.
- open-loop control: The control system in which input or controlling action does not depend on the output is called an Open-loop control system.
- closed-loop control: The control system in which input or controlling action does not depend on the output is called an Open-loop control system.
